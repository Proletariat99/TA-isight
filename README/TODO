# Bert Shuler (Splunk) and Dave Dyer (Science)
# This is our list of stuff to do for version 1.1 
# Current Version = 1.0 
# Next Version = 1.1
# TODO List for 1.1:
- Update code to work in Windows 
  - replace shell scripting with more pythony stuff (or os.check followed by .bat -- kinda ghetto)
  - double check path capabilities
- refactor error logging to include actual logging in def function
- probably remove main.py 


# Fixed from last version:
- fix the time_tracker file to not grow infinitely -- only needs to keep 3 values.
- add some logging (general debug logging using Splunk's builtin capabilities)
x (not applicable) put it in an infinite loop so that it's a singleton when it runs.
x (not applicable -- different approach -- inputs.conf setting) make the singleton configurable within the modular input settings (more settings)
x (not done -- future version) configure modular input capabilities for other isight rest endpoints (reports, indexes, warnings, etc).


# version 2.0 stuff
- compartmentalize iocs into file v. web v. email
- viz
- stats
- update web settings with advanced functionality (time, reports, etc)

# version 3.0 stuff
- separate configuration page to turn on the scheduled search.
